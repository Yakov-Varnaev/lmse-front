- [ ] make block list independant
- [ ] reuse block list in meta blocks(multi block)

- [ ] if meta block changes it's order then all children must be moved as well
- [ ] if meta block is deleted then all children block's must be deleted as well

- [ ] block create dialog must support parrent block prop

- [ ] there should be a way to add existing block to a meta block(and also there must be a way to move block out from meta block) (ideally this should be handled by block list somehow)
- [ ] block list should be flexible, there should be some usefull system of slots that will allow to create corouseles steppers and so on
